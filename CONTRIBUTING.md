To attempt a shared level of clarity the key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

### Promoting and Improving Adoption of Nourish.Party
At this time, we are unclear on how to best promote adoption of Nourish.Party. If you happen to have expertise in marketing open-source products, we'd love to hear from you! Drop us a line at [hello@nourish.party](mailto: hello@nourish.party).

### Setting up or Supporting a Nourish.Party instance
We intend to make setting up a Nourish.Party instance as painless as possible, however we are planning to do that by prioritizing a Heroku button type experience. If you have experience making one-click installs of applications on hosting control panels or work with cloud service providers, we'd love your help! Drop a line to [hello@nourish.party](mailto: hello@nourish.party).

### Extending the Nourish.Party ecosystem
Our goal is for Nourish.Party to plug directly into your existing distribution channels, from amazon stores to etsy to Discord to Slack. As you can imagine, that's quite a feat! If you'd like to get involved building an extension, we'd love for you to start building on our OAuth, REST, GraphQL, and Webhook APIs. (Which aren't designed, docuemnted, or built yet... BUT SOON).

### Improving the core Nourish.Party application
Right now, there are four ways to contribute

#### Providing Feedback to Nourish.Party Maintainers
Nourish.Party is open-source, community built software. While we intend to place the user first, we sometimes fail to do so. One of the most valuable thing you can do to improve the Nourish.Party is to provide us with specific, actionable and detailed feedback. We're especially interested in hearing about:

* How Nourish.Party is (or is not!) helping you achieve your goals for financial independence as an independent creative or a small group of creatives.
* Wins or bugs you experienced using Nourish as a supporter.
* Gaps in our documentation, either as a Nourish.Party site host, add-on developer, or contributor to the core nourish.party platform.
* Vulnerabilities or risks. Please report these to [security@nourish.party](mailto: security@nourish.party).

To provide feedback you *should* either create a ticket in our [issue tracker](https://github.com/wecohere/nourish.party/issues) or email [hello@nourish.party](mailto: hello@nourish.party).

#### Contributing Patches
Patches are very much welcome! From documentation improvements to bug fixes to features, we're grateful for any contributions you send our way. We strongly err on the side of merging patches, so long as the patch meets the following requirements:

* The patch *must* pass the automated tests, as that ensures there are not unexpected regressions in behavior.
* The patch *should* pass our automated style-guide checker, as that helps make the application easier to work with for all contributors.
* The patch *should* include inline documentation for non-private methods, as that helps new contributors learn why a given class or method exists.
* The patch *should* rely on i18n for user-facing content, as this makes customization and collaboration with non-programmer copy-editors much easier.
* The patch *should* be small, as that makes it easier to review and merge quickly.
* The patch *must not* reduce test coverage significantly, as that helps future contributors not break your amazing patch.
* The patch *must* be approved by a core maintainer, as we are the ones on the hook for maintaining it far into the future.

We strive to provide both automated feedback and human-written specific, actionable and kind feedback to contributors. That said, we are an all volunteer organization, which means we may not be as responsive or available as you would like. We ask that you are patient with us.
