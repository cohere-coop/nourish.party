Hello, and thanks for coming by!  This party is to celebrate and nourish creators and their communities.  Whether you're here to help us get set up, or here to enjoy the festivities, we're glad you're here.

## What is Nourish?
Nourish is software that lets you receive and take subscriptions, and manage access to digital goodies based on subscription level.  It's open source software that is free for you to download, install, and use.  All costs and benefits are solely managed by you.  Please see the license for more details.

## How do I use it?
There are two ways you can get started using Nourish:

* You can join an existing Nourish instance and submit your project. For instance, [nourish.party](https://www.nourish.party) is hosting this project.
* You can host your own! While we don't have super detailed setup instructions *just* yet, you can launch your own instance with your [Heroku](https://heroku.com) account. If you choose to host your own instance, you'll be responsible for security, hosting, maintenance, configuration, and moderating your community. Doesn't that sound fun!? Just click the big purple button below to start hosting your own Nourish Party!

## This is awesome! who are you and why are you doing this?
Nourish wouldn't be possible with several parties.

Cohere (wecohere.com) is Betsy, Zee, and Jennifer.  They have an annual end-of-year company hackathon/shutdown, and wanted to work on a project to give to others.  Cohere is deeply grateful to their friends who pitched in to make Nourish happen:

* Vikram for the beautiful visuals and smooth flow
* Dash for making it possible to offer subscription-based digital access

## Can I help?
Aww, thanks so much!  We're glad you've been enjoying the party and want to add even more to it. Please read our [contributing guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidance on how you can best contribute.

(We have a Nourish for Nourish, here's how to chip in)
